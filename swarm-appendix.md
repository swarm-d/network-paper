# SWARM Chain: A Purpose-Built L2 for Physical Infrastructure Networks

## Abstract

SWARM Chain is a Layer 2 solution specifically designed for decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Built with the unique requirements of infrastructure networks in mind, it provides native support for resource verification, micro-payments, and dynamic quality-of-service monitoring. SWARM Network, a decentralized cloud computing platform, serves as the reference implementation, demonstrating the chain's capabilities for large-scale infrastructure coordination.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) represent a growing sector in web3, enabling the tokenization and decentralization of real-world infrastructure. However, existing blockchain solutions are not optimized for the unique requirements of infrastructure networks, leading to inefficiencies in:
- Resource verification and monitoring
- Payment distribution
- Quality of service enforcement
- Network coordination

### 1.2 The SWARM Chain Solution
SWARM Chain addresses these challenges through:
- Purpose-built infrastructure for DePIN projects
- Optimized transaction layer for micro-payments
- Native support for resource verification
- Built-in quality of service monitoring
- Reference implementation through SWARM Network

## 2. Technical Architecture
