# Chapter 6: Core Infrastructure Services

## 6.1 Introduction to SWARM Infrastructure

SWARM provides a comprehensive suite of infrastructure services designed to meet the demands of modern applications while maintaining simplicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Our infrastructure services are built on the principle of "complexity hidden, not eliminated" â€“ offering sophisticated capabilities through simple interfaces.

The core infrastructure is divided into three primary categories:
- Compute Services
- Storage Solutions
- Networking Services

Each category is designed to work independently while maintaining seamless integration capabilities, allowing users to build everything from simple web applications to complex, distributed systems.

## 6.2 Compute Services

### 6.2.1 Virtual Machines

SWARM Virtual Machines (XVMs) provide flexible, secure, and high-performance compute resources. Unlike traditional cloud providers, XVMs are designed with a focus on simplicity and predictable pricing while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.

Key Features:
- Instant provisioning (average startup time: 30 seconds)
- Auto-scaling based on workload patterns
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Automated backup and recovery
- Security-first design with encrypted storage

Example VM Configuration:
```yaml
compute_instance:
  name: "production-web"
  size: "swarm.standard.4"  # 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM
  image: "ubuntu-22.04-lts"
  zone: "us-east-1"
  features:
    encrypted_boot: true
    monitoring: "enhanced"
    auto_recovery: true
  network:
    type: "high_performance"
    bandwidth: "10Gbps"
  storage:
    root: 
      size: "100GB"
      type: "ssd"
    data:
      size: "500GB"
      type: "nvme"
```

Implementation Details:
```typescript
class XVMManager {
    async createInstance(config: VMConfig): Promise<VMInstance> {
        // Validate configuration
        this.validateConfig(config);
        
        // Check resource availability
        await this.checkResources(config);
        
        // Initialize virtual machine
        const instance = await this.provisionVM(config);
        
        // Configure networking
        await this.setupNetworking(instance, config.network);
        
        // Initialize storage
        await this.initializeStorage(instance, config.storage);
        
        // Start monitoring
        await this.enableMonitoring(instance, config.features.monitoring);
        
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 6.2.2 Container Platform

The SWARM Container Platform provides a robust environment for running containerized applications, built on Kubernetes but simplified for ease of use. Our platform abstracts away the complexity of container orchestration while providing full access to Kubernetes capabilities when needed.

Key Benefits:
- Zero-configuration container deployment
- Automatic load balancing and scaling
- Built-in service discovery
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines
- Native monitoring and logging

Example Container Deployment:
```yaml
container_service:
  name: "web-app"
  image: "nginx:latest"
  replicas: 3
  resources:
    cpu: "2"
    memory: "4Gi"
  scaling:
    min: 3
    max: 10
    target_cpu_utilization: 75
  networking:
    type: "mesh"
    domain: "myapp.swarm.network"
```

### 6.2.3 Serverless Functions

SWARM Serverless Functions enable developers to run code without managing servers, with advanced features like automatic scaling, integrated monitoring, and pay-per-execution pricing.

Features:
- Multiple runtime support (Node.js, Python, Go, Java)
- HTTP and event triggers
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Built-in API gateway integration
- Cold start optimization

Example Function:
```typescript
import { SWARMFunction } from '@swarm/serverless';

export const handler = SWARMFunction.create({
    runtime: 'nodejs18',
    memory: '512MB',
    timeout: '30s',
    scaling: {
        minInstances: 0,
        maxInstances: 100,
        concurrency: 80
    }
}, async (event, context) => {
    // Function logic here
    const result = await processEvent(event);
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify(result)
    };
});
```

## 6.3 Storage Solutions

        bucket: string,
        key: string,
        data: Buffer,
        options: StorageOptions
    ): Promise<UploadResult> {
        // Calculate optimal chunk size
        const chunkSize = this.calculateChunkSize(data.length);

        const chunks = this.splitIntoChunks(data, chunkSize);
        
        // Upload chunks in parallel
        const uploads = await Promise.all(
            chunks.map(chunk => this.uploadChunk(bucket, key, chunk))
        );
        
        // Finalize upload
        return this.finalizeUpload(bucket, key, uploads);
    }
}
```

### 6.3.2 Block Storage

SWARM Block Storage provides high-performance block-level storage volumes for use with SWARM Virtual Machines and containers. Our block storage is designed for both high-performance workloads and cost-effective general purposes.

    }
}
```

## 6.5 Integration and Management

### 6.5.1 Resource Management API

SWARM provides a unified API for managing all infrastructure resources, making it easy to automate and integrate with existing tools and workflows.

Example API Usage:
```typescript
const swarm = new SWARMClient({
    region: 'us-east-1',
    credentials: {
        accessKey: process.env.SWARM_ACCESS_KEY,
        secretKey: process.env.SWARM_SECRET_KEY
    }
});

// Create a complete application stack
async function deployApplication() {
    // Create VPC and networking
    const network = await swarm.network.createVPC({
        name: 'production',
        cidr: '10.0.0.0/16'
    });
    
    // Deploy compute resources
    const compute = await swarm.compute.createCluster({
        name: 'web-cluster',
        size: 3,
        machine_type: 'swarm.standard.4'
    });
    
    // Set up load balancer
    const lb = await swarm.loadBalancer.create({
        name: 'web-lb',
        type: 'application',
        targets: compute.instances
    });
    
    // Configure DNS
    await swarm.dns.createRecord({
        name: 'myapp.example.com',
        type: 'A',
        value: lb.address
    });
}
```
