# SWARM Chain: A Purpose-Built L1 for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure

## Abstract

SWARM Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). Built with a novel Proof of Physical Resource (PoPR) consensus mechanism, SWARM Chain enables efficient resource verification, real-time payments, and automated service level agreements. Using SWARM Cloud, a decentralized cloud computing platform, as its reference implementation, SWARM Chain demonstrates how physical infrastructure can be effectively decentralized and tokenized.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
DePIN networks are transforming how physical infrastructure is provisioned and consumed. However, current blockchain solutions, designed for general-purpose computation, impose unnecessary overhead and limitations on DePIN operations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Existing chains present several challenges for DePIN networks:
- High transaction costs for micro-payments
- Inefficient resource verification
- Limited support for real-time service monitoring
- Non-optimized state management for physical resources
- Misaligned economic incentives
